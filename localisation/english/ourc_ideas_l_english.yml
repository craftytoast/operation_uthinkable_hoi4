 GER_forced_rhenish_trade_embargo:0 "Forced Rhenish Trade Embargo"
 GER_forced_rhenish_trade_embargo_desc:0 "The Stalinists of the USSR had imposed a forced embargo with the Rhenish Worker's Authority on us and the same on the Rhineland. This has led to catastrophic amounts of §Hfood shortages§! among the populace, especially the less rural and mountainous south of §HBavaria, Baden and Württemberg§!. Though, it was merely Joseph Stalin who enacted this policy, meaning we could make change to this due to him not being in power anymore. The Rhineland posseses the Ruhr Valley, without which Germany is weak and less industrious than other nations."
 
 GER_doubtful_workers:0 "Doubtful Workers"
 GER_doubtful_workers_desc:0 "Since the §H1953 German Worker Uprising§!, there has been significant amounts of similar events, such as protests and strikes taking place. The former Western Allied Occupation Zone had experienced the most after-effects of the Uprising, one of them being that it is more underdeveloped than the east. Due to the catastrophic scale of the events of 1953, the workers are yet to be in full support of the regime, as such they tend to 'slack off' on the job, and be less productive. Sometimes around the commemoration of the mass strikes, which took place between §H15th-19th June§!, regardless more protests and strikes took place, albeit in smaller scale even months after the five days, workers strike and protest on the beginning and end day of the Uprising. The cause of the Uprising was §Hproduction quotas§!, and doubt that rules the workers has made one thing clear: No more production quotas."
 
 GER_outdated_leadership:0 "Outdated Leadership"
 GER_outdated_leadership_desc:0 "The §HSED§! and its forefront have still remained Stalinist and pro-Soviet. They are loyal to the Soviet Union and what they have done to Germany, even though they have done many acts that are outright bad and insulting to Germany and her people, such as the forced embargo with the Rhineland. §HWilhelm Pieck, Otto Grotewohl and Walter Ulbricht§! are all §Hpro-Soviet§!, and seem to sacrifice the German people's well being for good relations with the §HUSSR§!. As a result, we have remained with no say in the §HSoviet policies for Germany§!. The USSR is a source of good and peace, but in order to keep that peace Germany must be an §Hally instead of a tool§!."
 
 GER_nationale_volksarmee:0 "Nationale Volksarmee"
 GER_nationale_volksarmee_desc:0 "The §HNational People's Army§! was formed only last year out of the §HKasernierte Volkspolizei§!, and is still in it's organizational buildup and recruitment phase. The equipment is merely old Soviet tech, with none of it being very modern. There are only 100,000 members as of now, a lot of them being former §HWehrmacht§! members, and most ranks are also held by former Wehrmacht officers. Our doctrine and structure still developing, though it is mostly influenced by the §HSoviet Army§!. The §HNVA§!'s only operations as of now are hunting down the radical rightists and Nazis, as well as Western and anti-communist spies. Future plans as of now are to model it off of the Soviet Army and expand its other branches, such as the §HVolksmarine§! and §HLuftstreitkräfte§!."
