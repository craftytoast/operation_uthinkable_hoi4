 GER_OURC_DESC:0 "After the Second Great War, Germany was left in ruins, but then, Operation Unthinkable began, and the West lost. As such, the Western Occupation Zone had fallen into the hands of the East. In the aftermath of the victory, various German, Polish and Soviet political figures met in Essen. Germany was to be reorganized in the context of its 1937 borders: the Soviets would annex Königsberg, renaming it to Kaliningrad, Poland would annex everything up to the Oder-Neisse line, the Rhenish Worker's Authority and the Austrian People's Socialist Republic would be established, and the rest of Germany would be a satellite state of the USSR. The Treaty of Essen had taken effect."
