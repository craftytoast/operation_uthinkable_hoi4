 GER_wilhelm_pieck_desc:0 "Born on 3 January 1876 in Guben, east of the Oder-Neisse Line, §HFriedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck§! is a staunch pro-Soviet and formerly, though still informally stalinist German politician. He served as the §Hchairman§! of the §HSocialist Unity Party of Germany§! from 1946 to 1950 and is the current §HPresident§! of the §HGerman Democratic Republic§!. His positions were, even though he lost leadership of the SED, due to §HJoseph Stalin's trust§! of him. In 1953, however, one month after the §HGerman Worker Uprising§!, he suffered a §Hstroke§!. This was caused by stress and anxiety from the aftermath of the Uprising, but, although he survived it, it was §Hdevastating§! to his health. He was, 2 days after the stroke, sent to the most skilled doctors of the DDR, and received care there. After his condition stabilized, he was escorted to the most skilled doctors in the entire Eastern bloc, and was healthy again. §HAfter-effects§! are, however, still seen on him, though, since the stroke. §HAnother event like the Uprising§! could potentially cause his §Hthird stroke§!, and potentially §Hfinal§! stroke of his life."
