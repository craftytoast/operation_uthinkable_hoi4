 GER_wilhelm_pieck_desc:0 "Born on 3 January 1876 in Guben, east of the Oder-Neisse Line, §HFriedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck§! is a staunch pro-Soviet and formerly, though still informally stalinist German politician. He served as the §Hchairman§! of the §HSocialist Unity Party of Germany§! from 1946 to 1950 and is the current §HPresident§! of the §HGerman Democratic Republic§!. His positions were, even though he lost leadership of the SED, due to §HJoseph Stalin's trust§! of him. In 1953, however, one month after the §HGerman Worker Uprising§!, he suffered a §Hstroke§!. This was caused by stress and anxiety from the aftermath of the Uprising, but, although he survived it, it was §Hdevastating§! to his health. He was, 2 days after the stroke, sent to the most skilled doctors of the DDR, and received care there. After his condition stabilized, he was escorted to the most skilled doctors in the entire Eastern bloc, and was healthy again. §HAfter-effects§! are, however, still seen on him, though, since the stroke. §HAnother event like the Uprising§! could potentially cause his §Hthird stroke§!, and potentially §Hfinal§! stroke of his life."
 ENG_harold_wilson_desc:0 "Born James Harold Wilson on the 11th of March 1916 in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, Harold Wilson has served the Labour Party since 1945, and as Prime Minister since 1950, after the Attlee government ended in flames. In the Attlee government, he served as Secretary for Overseas Trade, and was at the forefront of the ensuing Labour leadership struggle. There he captured the hearts of his fellow Labourites, and led them to victory in 1950, despite the odds. However, Wilson and his government have fallen on hard times in his second term. What started as a promising second term quickly descended into chaos, as projects that Wilson and his advisors invested heavily into quickly collapsed, as well as the extensive nationalisation plans. After this catastrophe, a Vote of No Confidence in Wilson was passed, and now Wilson must desperately try to hold on to leadership of the Labour Party, lest he fall into political irrelevancy."
